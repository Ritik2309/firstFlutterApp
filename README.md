My first Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application and to monitor my progress by following an online codelab.

The resources I will be using for the Flutter project:

[Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
[Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
